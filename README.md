# SQL_Customers_DB_querying
In this project, I've used intermediate to advanced level SQL queries to work with a set of customer, orders, and payments data.

For demonstration purposes, I created a database containing multiple tables, such as customers, orders, order items, products, and payments, with a range of records in each table.

I've employed various SQL techniques, including Joins, Aggregations (SUM, AVG), Grouping (GROUP BY), Ordering (ORDER BY), and filtering (WHERE), to analyze and manipulate the data. Additionally, I worked with Foreign Keys, Null values, and also performed tasks like updating, deleting records, and managing relationships between tables.
